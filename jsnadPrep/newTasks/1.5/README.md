Task 4: Async Event Emitter

Description:
You have to complete the setupEmitter function, which involves adding an event listener and emitting an event. You cannot modify the structure of the existing code, but you must:

Add an asynchronous event listener that simulates a delay (e.g., using setTimeout or Promise).

Wait 1 second inside the listener before logging "Event received".

Emit the event 1 second after the listener is set up.
