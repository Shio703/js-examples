Task 1: Complete File Processing

Description:
You are given the processFile function, which already has a defined structure. Your task is to:

Read a file (input.txt) asynchronously.

Convert the content to uppercase.

Write the result to a new file (output.txt).
You cannot modify the existing code in the function, but you need to add the logic to complete the task.
