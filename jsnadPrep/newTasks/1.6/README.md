Task 5: Directory File Filter

Description:
The getTextFiles function is incomplete. You need to implement the missing parts to:

Read all files in the current directory (fs.promises.readdir).

Return an array of files that end with .txt.
You are not allowed to modify the existing code, only to fill in the missing logic.
